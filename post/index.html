						<p>Tormenta is a brazilian RPG based on D&amp;D (Open Game License was a bless) very similar to D&amp;D3.5 but with a totally different and new scene. The spells and feats are very similar, having a few differences in the mechanics and rules.</p>

<div align="center" style="margin-bottom: 30px">
    <a href="http://jamboeditora.com.br/"><img height="150" src="logo-tormenta.png"></a>
</div>

<p>As a RPG player and master, a great part of the time playing was devoted to search stuff in the books during the game. In TormentaRPG, we have a lot of them, and had even more in D&amp;D. To make the RPG sessions faster and more fluid, I adapted the <a href="https://roenmidnight.github.io/grimorio-trpg">RoenMidnight&rsquo;s Grimório TRPG</a> to Angular.js, being even easier to adapt and add features.</p>

<p>So, <a href="https://github.com/roenmidnight">RoenMidnight</a> came up with the idea, based on an existing grimoir for D&amp;D, to make an online grimoir for Tormenta. I translated the entire work that Roen made and added a few of the feats present in Tormenta in a section that didn&rsquo;t exist in RoenMidnight&rsquo;s grimoir. Also, to make my version unique, I changed the name of the website to Tormenta Spellbook, that can be accessed in the image below.</p>

<p>First of all, it is important to say that i made this project only for fun and to practice what I already knew about Angular.js. Second, I made this in the most basic way to do it, and the most sophisticated thing i did was nesting views and promise chaining. Also, I changed the original data using simple python scripts (didn&rsquo;t even knew how to properly use python libs back then) managing json in pure string. I&rsquo;ll soon be updating the scripts and adding proper comments to them.</p>

<p>Hope all the RPG players keep the dices rolling, and lets play!</p>

<p>During the class, we learned code patterns and, in the end of the class, we had to develop (and fix) a project given by Melina. The project had 13 main user stories and 3 aditional user stories:</p>

<p>Main user stories:</p>

<ol>
<li>As an admin, I would like to have the system persisting all the data;</li>
<li>As an admin, I would like to login in the system to have access to all the admin funcionalities;</li>
<li>As an admin, I would like to access the system through a link;</li>
<li>I, as a client, would like to consult the disponibility and price of each product of the supermarket without the need of being logged in;</li>
<li>As an admin, I would like to order the products and the record of sales according to their important information (i.e. name, price, etc);</li>
<li>As an admin, I would like to set up discounts to the product categories, in a way that the costumer receives it in the end of the buying process. The discount categories are: 0% (no discount), 10% (good), 25% (great) and 50% (super);</li>
<li>As an admin, I would like to see a general report of the supermarket, with the products and their data (quantity, number of packs, expiration date, etc), sales record and profit;</li>
<li>As an admin, I would like to see the product marked as unavailable if it has zero items or if its expired. Also, if its unavailable, the system doesn&rsquo;t show its price and the product is added, if its expired, should be added to the list of expired products;</li>
<li>As an admin, I would like to register a sale of a product, recording the value of the purchase. The product quantity must be decremented;</li>
<li>As an admin, I would like to cancel a sale of a product, deleting the record of the sale. The product quantity must be incremented;</li>
<li>As an admin, I would like to receive notifications in the home screen warning if a product is under 15 units;</li>
<li>As an admin, I would like to receive notifications in the home screen warning if a product is about to expire (1 month or less);</li>
</ol>

<p>Aditional user stories:</p>

<ol>
<li>As a client, I would like to sign up to access the system;</li>
<li>As a client, I would like to log in to access the client funcionalities;</li>
<li>As a client, I would like to bookmark my shopping list in the system, so my purchases would be collected and packaged in advance.</li>
</ol>

<p>We made a group then, with me, <a href="https://github.com/IannCarvalho">Iann</a>, <a href="https://github/docinho">Livia</a> and <a href="https://github.com/marcusvlc">Marcus</a>. Initially, the system didn&rsquo;t follow almost any code patterns, and we had to fix and put the correct patterns in the code (both front and back). After that, we started implementing the new features (given in the user stories above) and our group subdivided in 2 lesser groups: Livia and Marcus in the backend, me and Iann in the frontend.</p>

<p>We started by refactoring the whole project to have less imports in each controller and separating the angular controllers. After that, the implementation of services to hold the http requests, passed to the controllers in promise chaining. After that, we reimplemented the whole system to work only in one language (previously portuguese and english mixed up): english.</p>

<p>The result code can be found in <a href="https://github.com/docinho/projetosi">Livia&rsquo;s repository</a> with our contributions.</p>

						<p>Libratizar is a Startup from Campina Grande with focus in inclusive education. Our main proposal is that education should be to everyone.</p>

<p>The Libratizar started in Campina Grande in the 14th FETECh, organized by the Parque Tecnológico/PB (<a href="http://www.paqtc.org.br/">PaqTecPB</a>) and the Incubadora Tecnológica de Campina Grande (<a href="http://www.paqtc.org.br/portal_novo/3versao/html_itcg/incubadora.jsp">ITCG</a>), during the 1st FETECh Hackathon. I made my subscription to the event with 2 other friends, <a href="https://github.com/joserenan">Renan</a> and <a href="https://github.com/marianabianca">Mariana</a>, but the teams were drawn in the beginning of the competition, revealed with the theme.</p>

<p><img src="fetech.jpg" alt="14th FETECh" /></p>

<p>After a while, the team was revealed: Me, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/kalinafr/">Kalina Ferreira</a> and Samuel Rufino. The theme of the competition was impact business in education. We watched a few lectures by <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/mfukayama/">Marcel Fukayama</a> from Din4mo, <a href="https://sites.google.com/a/computacao.ufcg.edu.br/hyggo/">Hyggo Almeida</a>, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/danilo-santos-41261314/">Danilo Santos</a> and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/ver%C3%B4nica-mac%C3%A1rio-28283364/">Veronica Macario</a>.</p>

<p>We spent a lot of time thinking what our team would do based on the theme of the competition. A few not so great - still valid - ideas were coming up, and I had a very primitive idea. The rest of the team kept the discussion about the existing ideas going and I started walking and writing in a piece of paper, while listening to music, trying to refine it.</p>

<p align="center">
  <img src="idea.jpg">
</p>

<p>After 15 or 20 minutes, I came back and the idea was ready: We should do a startup focused in the education of deaf children, something like an online platform where kids all around the country could access video lectures made by pedagogical teachers and taught in LIBRAS (Brasilian Language of Signs). We included a gamification learning process, studied statistics, came up with investment needing to put the startup in the market and a lot more. Kalina made the mocks of the pages, Samuel made the use case diagram and I started programming an example of what the page would be using Angular.js.</p>

<p align="center">
  <img height="225" width="400" src="logo-libratizar.png"> <!-- 9/16 -->
</p>

<p>48 hours later, we had a name, a logo and a purpose: to make Libratizar a real startup in education: every brazilian deaf children should be able to write and read portuguese. In the final pitch I was chosen to present our startup and that was it. The hackathon was finished and the final standings were revealed, and the competition that should only have one winner had changed: unfortunately, we didn&rsquo;t win, but still, we were in second place and it was amazing for us.</p>

<p>A month later, we received the invitation to present our startup in the 3rd Startup Workshop of Campina Grande and again I presented our startup. It was a great honor for all of us to do such a thing.</p>

					</header>
					<div class="entry-content">
						<p>Hey everyone!</p>

<p>My <a href="https://juliobguedes.github.io/portfolio-vis/">data visualization</a> page was created using Hugo to host a series of visualizations made in d3.js and Vega Lite, a d3 compiler. All of them were made in the DataVis class @ UFCG, taught by <a href="https://github.com/nazareno/">Nazareno Andrade</a>, with the purpose to learn d3.js, the tecniques and theory about visualizations.</p>

<p>In each post, I&rsquo;ll present the same guide made by Nazareno that lead me to create the visualizations. I a few of them I made use of Python to modify the original data. The Python scripts are simple and shouldn&rsquo;t be hard for you to understand them. Both data and the scripts are (or soon will be) linked to the post.</p>

<p>You all should know that d3.js is a powerful tool to make visualizations, so feel free to change the data and the visualization to learn more from it.</p>

<p>Hope you all enjoy it!</p>
